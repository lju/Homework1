To run the game, simply open asteroids.html on a browser.

You can cheat your way through the game by pressing

'=': increase score
'-': decrease score

This will automatically change the level, which determines how often enemies
spawn and how hard they are. Some weird things might happen if decrease the
score (e.g. multiple final bosses), but increasing the score should work fine.


You'll want to get to level 6, though, because...you'll see.
